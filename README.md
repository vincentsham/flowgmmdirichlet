# FlowGMMDirichlet

The visualizations are captured the latent space of training data at training step 0-9, 10, 20, 30, ..., 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, ..., 3800, 3900, 4000.

The dot and circle correspond to the mean and std of GMM components. During training, the GMM components either disappear or turn from grey to the assigned class color.
